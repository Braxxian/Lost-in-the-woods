# Lost in the woods

A text based adventure game. The player must navigate the options of the story to arrive at one of two possible endings. The game code is written in Python and uses the code institute template for deployment to Heroku cloud hosting platform.

## Responsive Design

![Am I Responsive](README_Docs/amiresponsive.JPG)

The game renders well across all screen sizes, although it is best suited for devices with a physical keyboard.

# How to play

The player is given a short intro and then informed to make a choice of 'A' or 'B' and then press 'Enter' to confirm their choice.

## Planning & Development
### User stories

* As a user I enjoy retro-style text adventures
* As a user I want to be able to play the game on desktop, laptop or tablet.
* As a user I am interested in basic python programming.
* As a user I want a demonstration of how basic python can be used to create a text adventure

### Site Owner goals

* As the site owner I want to provide a fun game that does not require a large amount of the user's time
* As the site owner I want to provide a 'proof of concept' to help other students see how basic python can be used to create a game
* As the site owner I want to be able to extend the sites features in future development

## Features

### Game terminal

* The game offers two different user experiences. One branch of the game leads to a happy ending, another branch of the game leads to a bad ending.
* The game uses ASCII Art and color to enhance the terminal's visual impact
* The game opens with an introductory sequence which includes instruction on how to proceed
* The game offers a restart button so player can restart without needing to execute a keyboard interupt

## Early Stages

### Original Design

The original design concept was based purely on story telling. Reading text from a file. Also the path tree of the storyline was more complex.

## Revised design

The original model was stream-lined into two distinct paths. This made for more efficient code and better story rationale.

## future development

I would like to add more encounters in the story. Also I would like to develop the complexity of the story branches

# Testing

### Manual Testing

The game was tested thoroughly for handling invalid user input and correct game output

| User Action        | Expected Result                 | Actual Result                   | Pass / Fail |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Run the program    | Display game title and intro    | Displayed game title and intro  | Pass        |
| Choose 'A' branch  | Follow branch A storyline       | Followed branch A storyline     | Pass        |
| Choose 'B' branch  | Follow branch B storyline       | Followed branch B storyline     | Pass        |
| Make choices (A/B) | Display appropriate game text   | Displayed correct game text     | Pass        |
| Play again (y/n)   | Restart or exit the game        | Restarted or exited the game    | Pass        |
| Invalid input      | Prompt for valid input          | Prompted for valid input        | Pass        |
| Interrupt with Ctrl+C | Handle keyboard interrupt    | Handled keyboard interrupt      | Pass        |

## bugs

There were no major bugs found during development and testing, and all minor issues were resolved in the development process

# Technologies used

 All code was written using: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Repository: [Github](https://github.com/)

Deployment: [Heroku](Heroku.com/)

# Deployment

## Important:

Before deploying to Heroku, make sure that the requirements.txt in your GitHub repository files contain any libarary dependencies:

<img src="README_Docs/require.JPG">

Also ensure any API keys used have been included to .gitignore to keep keys private.

The repository was deployed to Heroku:

First create a new app:
name your app and choose region:

<img src="README_Docs/Deploy1.JPG">

Add port to config and python, node.js build packs

<img src="README_Docs/Deploy2.JPG">

Finally:

    * Connect Heroku to github
    * Authorise the connection
    * Choose repository to connect
    * optionally enable automatic deploys. I chose to deploy each repository update manually so I could observed the process for any errors.

### Note:

As this project was already deployed at the time of writing, further screenshots are unavailable.
