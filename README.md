## Planning & Development
### User stories

* As a user I want an entertaining game that can be enjoyed in short leisure breaks
* As a user I want to be able to play the game across all my different devices
* As a user I want to be able to easily learn how to play
* As a user I want a demonstration of how basic python can be used to create a text adventure

### Site Owner goals

* As the site owner I want to provide a fun game that does not require a large amount of the user's time
* As the site owner I want to provide a 'proof of concept' to help other students see how basic python can be used to create a game
* As the site owner I want to be able to extend the sites features in future development

## Features

* The game offers two different user experiences. One branch of the game leads to a happy ending, another branch of the game leads to a bad ending.
* The game uses ASCII Art and color to enhance the terminal's visual impact
* The game opens with an introductory sequence which includes instruction on how to proceed
